Instructions
============
1. npm install
2. npm start (opens the development server at localhost:3000 and also opens a browser).

3. Some setups: The server runs at port 3000 which is different from where the microservices (eg. muxer) is running. But Chrome (and most browsers) have a CORS policy which restricts a browser to access resources from different host. To avert this, you can install third party anti-CORS plugins. Such as the following, with which I have tested it.

  Plugin name: Allow-Control-Allow-Origin:* 
  By:  vitvad

On the "intercepted URLs" field of the plugin, insert the following (which is the streaming microservice's address)

  "Intercepted URL": http://127.0.0.1:9999/*

That is it!
